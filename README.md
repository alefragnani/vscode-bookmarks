## Available settings

* Allow navigation through all files that contains bookmarks
```
    "bookmarks.navigateThroughAllFiles": true
```

* Bookmarks are always saved between sessions, and you can decide if it should be saved _in the Project_, so you can add it to your Git/SVN repo and have it in all your machines _(`false` by default)_
```
    "bookmarks.saveBookmarksInProject": true
```

> the `saveBookmarksBetweenSessions` setting was replaced by this this in version 0.13.0

* Path to another image to be shown as Bookmark (16x16 px)
```
    "bookmarks.gutterIconPath": "c:\\temp\\othericon.png"
```

## Treeview

A first step on a **Bookmarks Treeview** was added in this release, and now you have a list of all your bookmarks, right in the Explorer panel. A few commands were added:
* Jump to a bookmark, simply clicking in the bookmark item
* Remove a bookmark, right clicking in the bookmark item
* Clear the bookmark's file, right-clickin in the file item

![Treeview](images/vscode-bookmarks-treeview-preview.gif)

#### Treeview is Optional

> _new in version 0.17.0_

You can choose if you want to see the Treeview.

```json 
    "bookmarks.treeview.visible": true
```

### Known issues

* Renaming/deleting a file does not update the file item
* Changing the content of a bookmarked line does not update the bookmark item 

> Use the `Refresh` button in the Treeview title

## Project and Session Based

The bookmarks are saved _per session_ for the project that you are using. You don't have to worry about closing files in _Working Files_. When you reopen the file, the bookmarks are restored.

It also works even if you only _preview_ a file (simple click in TreeView). You can put bookmarks in any file and when you preview it again, the bookmarks will be there.
